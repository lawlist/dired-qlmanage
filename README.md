`qlmanage` is a function available on OSX / MacOS.

USAGE:  Evaluate `dired-qlmanage.el`.  Open a `dired-mode` buffer and press the space-bar on a desired file to open a `qlmanage` window.  Hit the space-bar again to cancel `qlmanage` or mouse-click the "X" in the upper left-hand corner of `qlmanage`.  When the `qlmanage` window is open, the previous or next file in the `dired-mode` buffer can be viewed by using the up/down arrow keys.
